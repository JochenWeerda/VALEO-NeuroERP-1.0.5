# Multi-Agent Framework for VALEO-NeuroERP

## Overview

The VALEO-NeuroERP system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture based on the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. This document outlines the parallel agent operation, handover protocols, and integration with the APM phases.

## Multi-Channel Agent Architecture

### Agent Types and Roles

The system employs five specialized agent types working in parallel:

1. **VAN Agent (Validate, Analyze, Think)**
   - Analyzes system state and business data
   - Identifies patterns and anomalies
   - Validates requirements against implementation

2. **PLAN Agent (Planner)**
   - Creates strategic plans based on analysis
   - Prioritizes tasks and allocates resources
   - Establishes milestones and timelines

3. **CREATE Agent (Creator)**
   - Generates code, designs, and content
   - Creates implementation blueprints
   - Develops creative solutions to problems

4. **IMPLEMENT Agent (Implementer)**
   - Executes plans and integrates components
   - Deploys solutions and tests functionality
   - Ensures technical compatibility

5. **REVIEW Agent (Reviewer)**
   - Evaluates results against requirements
   - Identifies improvements and issues
   - Provides feedback for the next cycle

### Parallel Pipeline Operation

Unlike traditional sequential agent workflows, VALEO-NeuroERP implements a parallel pipeline where:

- Multiple agents operate simultaneously on different phases
- Each agent immediately begins its next task after handover
- The system maintains a continuous flow of work
- Resource utilization is maximized through parallel processing

## Handover Protocol

### Structured Handover Documents

Each agent produces a formal handover document at phase completion containing:

1. **Summary of Work Completed**
   - Key findings or outputs
   - Decisions made and their rationale
   - Metrics and performance indicators

2. **Context for Next Agent**
   - Critical information needed by the next agent
   - Assumptions and constraints
   - Unresolved questions or issues

3. **Recommendations**
   - Suggested next steps
   - Potential challenges to address
   - Priority items requiring attention

### Handover Format

All handovers follow a standardized Markdown format:

```markdown
# [PHASE] Handover: [Task Name]

## Summary
- Key finding 1
- Key finding 2
- Key finding 3

## Context
- Critical information
- Assumptions
- Constraints

## Recommendations
- Next step 1
- Next step 2
- Next step 3

## Metrics
- Metric 1: Value
- Metric 2: Value
- Metric 3: Value
```

## Integration with APM Framework

The multi-agent system is fully integrated with the APM Framework phases:

### 1. Collect Phase
- **Responsible Agent**: VAN
- **Activities**: Data gathering, metrics collection
- **Handover**: Standardized metrics format, data quality validation

### 2. Detect Phase
- **Responsible Agent**: VAN
- **Activities**: Anomaly detection, pattern recognition
- **Handover**: Classified anomalies, priority levels, context information

### 3. Diagnose Phase
- **Responsible Agent**: PLAN
- **Activities**: Root cause analysis, impact assessment
- **Handover**: Problem analysis, recommendations, prioritized actions

### 4. Resolve Phase
- **Responsible Agents**: CREATE and IMPLEMENT
- **Activities**: Solution development, implementation, testing
- **Handover**: Documentation of changes, success metrics

### 5. Monitor & Validate Phase
- **Responsible Agent**: REVIEW
- **Activities**: Performance monitoring, validation of changes
- **Handover**: Feedback to VAN for next iteration

## Memory Bank Implementation

### FastMCP-RAG with MongoDB

The system implements a persistent memory mechanism using:

- **MongoDB** as vector database for knowledge storage
- **FastMCP-RAG** for efficient retrieval of past context
- **Semantic search** to find relevant information

### Memory Access Patterns

- All agents share access to the Memory Bank
- Context is preserved across agent transitions
- Historical decisions and rationale are retrievable
- Memory is versioned to maintain consistency

## Orchestration Layer

The Orchestrator Agent coordinates the multi-agent workflow:

- Manages agent lifecycle and transitions
- Ensures proper handover execution
- Monitors overall system performance
- Resolves conflicts between agents
- Maintains global system state

## Implementation Guidelines

### Starting a New Agent Cycle

```python
# Initialize the VAN agent with context from Memory Bank
van_agent = AnalyzerAgent("van-1", "system_analysis")
context = memory_bank.get_latest_context()

# Begin analysis
analysis_results = await van_agent.analyze(context)

# Generate handover document
handover = create_handover_document(
    phase="VAN",
    task="System Analysis",
    results=analysis_results
)

# Store in Memory Bank and pass to PLAN agent
memory_bank.store_handover(handover)
plan_agent.receive_handover(handover)

# Immediately start next VAN task
next_task = orchestrator.get_next_task_for_agent("VAN")
van_agent.analyze(next_task)
```

### Parallel Execution Pattern

The system uses asynchronous programming to enable parallel agent execution:

```python
async def run_agent_pipeline():
    # Start all agent tasks in parallel
    van_task = asyncio.create_task(van_agent.process_queue())
    plan_task = asyncio.create_task(plan_agent.process_queue())
    create_task = asyncio.create_task(create_agent.process_queue())
    implement_task = asyncio.create_task(implement_agent.process_queue())
    review_task = asyncio.create_task(review_agent.process_queue())
    
    # Wait for all agents to complete their current cycle
    await asyncio.gather(
        van_task, plan_task, create_task, implement_task, review_task
    )
```

## Conclusion

The multi-agent framework in VALEO-NeuroERP represents a sophisticated implementation of the APM principles with parallel agent operation. By using structured handovers and a shared memory system, the agents work together efficiently while maintaining context and consistency throughout the development process.
